# ServoControl
Make sure you install, and have the newest version of python

Also make sure you have pygame installed

Open in any code editor and run while connected to a servo

Made specifically for, and on a raspberry pi so if connected to a different device I can't gurrantee it will work

Servo I used can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/Smraza-Helicopter-Airplane-Control-Arduino/dp/B07L2SF3R4/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2QQ4M3OGJCJEN&keywords=servos&qid=1669046759&sprefix=servos%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1

~~Connectors to connect servo to rasp pi can be found here: (will add later)~~

(tested on a raspberry pi 3b, also can't gurantee it'll work on any other hardware, also using raspberry pi os)
